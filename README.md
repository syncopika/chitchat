currently a work-in-progress (with a lot more work to be done)    
    
current look:

A key feature is being able to have complex ASCII/unicode emoticons on hand and ready for use! for when emojis just aren't good enough :)    
    
## TODO:    
- emoticon edit page/widget
- loading emoticons from a saved json?
- server needs to send user list
- messages from server should come with timestamp
- implement disconnect button in chat area page
- testing with multiple users
- implement avatar feature
