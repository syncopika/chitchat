// notes
problem: after I get a hello msg from a client, I want to send back a greeting AND a list of currently connected client usernames.
currently I attempt to do this in 2 separate messages. The problem is the first msg gets read due to the receiveMessage slot on the
client side but the 2nd message is still in the socket and there doesn't seem to be a way for the 2nd corresponding signal to wait
until the first one is done? so I was hoping the 2 signals would trigger the slot sequentially but I think the 2nd signal gets 'eaten'
when the first one is being processed. :( 

possible alternative solution: send greeting msg + client info in one socket write.
possible alt soln 2: forget the signal and slot for receiving and use a while loop in a separate thread?

use json for messages?
